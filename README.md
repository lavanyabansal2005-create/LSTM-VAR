# Forecasting Value-at-Risk with Deep Quantile Regression

This project implements a Deep Learning framework to forecast **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** for the S&P 500. By combining traditional financial feature engineering (GARCH, RiskMetrics) with the non-linear capabilities of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, this model directly predicts the 99% VaR threshold using **Deep Quantile Regression**.

## Project Overview

Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a standard metric in financial risk management used to estimate the potential loss of a portfolio at a given confidence level. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex non-linear dependencies or adapt quickly to changing volatility regimes.

This project benchmarks an LSTM-based Quantile Regression model against four industry-standard baselines to evaluate predictive accuracy and regulatory compliance.

## Methodology

### 1. Data and Feature Engineering
The model utilizes **30 years of S&P 500 data** augmented with the following risk factors:
* **Rolling GARCH(1,1) Volatility:** Statistical volatility measure refitted every 30 days.
* **RiskMetrics (EWMA) Volatility:** Exponentially weighted moving average (Lambda = 0.94).
* **VIX Index:** Implied volatility normalized to a daily scale.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 14-day momentum indicator.

### 2. Model Architecture and Hyperparameters
The architecture was optimized following the grid search methodology outlined in the *Journal of Financial Econometrics (Babii et al., 2022)*, favoring a regularized, shallow network to prevent overfitting:

* **Architecture:** 2-Stack LSTM
* **Units per Layer:** 10
* **Hidden Activation:** ReLU
* **Output Activation:** Linear
* **Regularization:** L2 Weight Decay (Lambda = 0.01) and 20% Dropout
* **Optimizer:** Adam (Learning Rate = 0.001)
* **Batch Size:** 20

## Backtesting and Comparative Analysis

The models were evaluated over **2,209 out-of-sample trading days** targeting a **1.0% Alpha** (99% Confidence Level).

### Global Model Comparison

| Model | Actual Breaches | Failure Rate (%) | Kupiec POF P-Value | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LSTM (Deep Quantile)** | **21** | **0.95%** | **0.8142** | **PASSED** |
| Quantile Regression | 25 | 1.13% | 0.5422 | **PASSED** |
| Polynomial Regression | 34 | 1.54% | 0.0183 | FAILED |
| Historical Simulation | 35 | 1.58% | 0.0110 | FAILED |
| Parametric (Normal) | 54 | 2.44% | 0.0000 | FAILED |

### Statistical Validation
1.  **Kupiec Proportion of Failures (POF):** The LSTM achieved a P-value of 0.8142, indicating its failure rate is statistically indistinguishable from the 1.0% target.
2.  **Regulatory Compliance:** With a 0.95% failure rate, the LSTM falls into the **Basel Green Zone**, satisfying international standards for market risk capital requirements.
3.  **Independence:** Analysis of consecutive hits confirmed that the LSTM significantly reduced breach clustering compared to Polynomial and Historical models.
