# DeepVaR: Forecasting Value-at-Risk with Deep Quantile Regression

This project implements a Deep Learning framework to forecast **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** for the S&P 500. By combining traditional financial feature engineering (GARCH, RiskMetrics) with the non-linear capabilities of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, this model directly predicts the 99% VaR threshold using **Quantile Regression**.



## Project Overview

Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a standard metric in financial risk management used to estimate the potential loss of a portfolio over a specific time frame at a given confidence level. Traditional methods (Parametric, Historical Simulation) often fail to capture complex non-linear dependencies or adapt quickly to changing volatility regimes.

This project overcomes those limitations by:
1.  **Hybrid Feature Engineering:** Feeding the LSTM with both raw returns and powerful statistical volatility estimates (GARCH, EWMA).
2.  **Deep Quantile Regression:** Optimizing the network using a custom **Pinball Loss** function to strictly learn the 1st percentile of the return distribution, rather than the mean.
3.  **Robust Backtesting:** Validating the model over ~24 years of data (including the 2008 and 2020 crises) to ensure regulatory compliance.

## Methodology

### 1. Data & Feature Engineering
The model utilizes **30 years of S&P 500 data** augmented with the following risk factors:
* **Log Returns:** The primary target for prediction.
* **Rolling GARCH(1,1) Volatility:** A statistical volatility measure refitted every 30 days and updated recursively to capture volatility clustering.
* **RiskMetrics (EWMA) Volatility:** An exponentially weighted moving average ($\lambda=0.94$) providing a baseline industry-standard risk measure.
* **VIX Index:** The "fear gauge," normalized to a daily volatility scale (`VIX / sqrt(252)`) to capture implied market sentiment.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** A 14-day momentum indicator used to detect overbought/oversold conditions.

### 2. Model Architecture
The core model is a stacked LSTM network built with TensorFlow/Keras:
* **Input Layer:** 60-day sliding window of the 5 input features.
* **Hidden Layers:**
    * LSTM (64 units) + Dropout (0.2)
    * LSTM (32 units) + Dropout (0.2)
* **Output Layer:** Dense (1 unit) predicting the VaR value directly.
* **Loss Function:** Custom **Quantile Loss** (Pinball Loss) at $\alpha = 0.01$. This forces the model to penalize underestimation of risk (breaches) significantly more than overestimation.

## Results & Backtesting

The model was backtested on **6,223 trading days** of out-of-sample data.

| Metric | Result | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confidence Level** | 99% | We expect breaches only 1% of the time. |
| **Expected Breaches** | 62 | The theoretical number of failures. |
| **Actual Breaches** | **57** | The actual number of times losses exceeded VaR. |
| **Failure Rate** | **0.92%** | Extremely close to the 1.0% target. |



### Regulatory Compliance (Basel Committee)
With a failure rate of **0.92%**, this model falls strictly within the **"Green Zone"** of the Basel Traffic Light approach, indicating it is statistically sound for calculating market risk capital requirements.
